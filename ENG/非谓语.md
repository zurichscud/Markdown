# 非谓语动词

非谓语动词不是动词，但是保留了动词的特点：可以有时态变化，且可以携带自己的宾语、状语等

| 非谓语 | 成分               |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| 不定式 | 名词、形容词、副词 |
| 动名词 | 名词               |
| 分词   | 形容词、副词       |

> With a beaming smile,she eagerly **stepped** onto the stage `to receive` her award,determined `to pursue` her dreams and inspire others `to do` the same
>
> determined 形容词 ，修饰she

# 不定式

to do，do为动词，如果to+名词，则不是不定式，而是介词短语

不定式：不一定是什么词性。不定式具备名词属性、形容词属性、副词属性。可以充当除了谓语之外的任何句子成分

## 不定式的含义

不定式表示一种不确定性，不确定动作是否要执行。

不定式表示一种推测，因为动作实际上并没有发生，也相当一种**将来**的含义

## 不定式的本质

不定式后面为什么接的是动词原形？这是因为不定式是情态助动词省略的结果

> I hope to see you
>
> I hope that I am able to see you
>
> 主语一致，am没有实际含义都可以进行省略
>
> to do本身就具有能够的含义，因此able也可以 省略

## 逻辑主语

逻辑主语是针对非谓语动词来说的。既然是动词，就应该有动作的执行者，即主语。之所以称为逻辑主语是为了区别于句子结构上的主语。

句子结构中的主语和非谓语动词的逻辑主语并不总是一致的



### for

> He is anxious for his sister to meet you 
>
> He is anxious that his sister could meet you



### of

形容词+to do时 可以使用of指示不定式的逻辑主语

> It is wise of you not to argue with your boss
>
> It is wise 
>
> You should not argure with your boss
